    deploy_changes mark-latest [optional sha1]
      - Run this after a successful deploy to mark the latest deploy SHA

    deploy_changes changed [file pattern]
      - Exits with 0 if a file pattern has changed since the last time we ran mark-latest.
      - Also exits with 0 if we haven't ran mark-latest yet
      - Exits with 1 if the file pattern has not changed
